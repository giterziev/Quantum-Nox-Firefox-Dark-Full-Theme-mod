> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### As stated in the **about** section, this is a personal fork of **[Izheil's Quantum Nox](https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme)** project to make it work in conjunction with [black7375's Lepton (Firefox-UI-Fix)](https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix).
> ### As it is a personal project, my main interest is in making Firefox visually appealing to me, and the functionality (that I use) added by either project to work.
> ### I will not, nor do I make any claims, to make both projects completely compatible with each other!

> [!CAUTION]
> ### I don't claim **any** part of either of those projects nor do I take any responsability in case it doesn't work for you, in case you decide to try it!

## :point_down: following are the steps I took:

1. Patched Firefox with [black7375's Lepton (Firefox-UI-Fix)](https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix), following their installation instructions.
2. Patched Firefox with [Izheil's Quantum Nox](https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme), following his installation instructions.
3. Adapted userChrome.css to **my personal needs**, eliminating conflicting/ unneeded entries.
